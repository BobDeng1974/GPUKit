# OXFEDE::GPUKit

A C++ framework for using OpenGL in an object oriented way.

This is work in progress...

## How to use it:
1. Include the whole GPUKit source folder in your project, or build it into a library and link against that.
2. Include `GPUKit.h` in your code. 
3. Make sure to call `GPUKit::init` before using anything else from the API.
4. Make sure to call `GPUKit::shutdown` when you are done and want to tear down the OpenGL context and window.
